This model is done from data from the module "ENVI70018 - Critical and Analytical Approaches to Environmental Resource Management 2024-2025" 
of M.Sc. programme "Environmental Technology" with specialization in "Envrironment Resource Management" from Imperial College London.
This model were adapted from an excel sheet model from the class by me as a self practice on MATLAB, as well as data analysis skills, to be used
as a project to be evaluated in my portfolio.
