# **Tree's carbon intake from a patch of land model**
This model is used to evaluate carbon absrobtion from a patch of a land with tree growth, as well as the biomass and the amount and year it tooks to
cultivate carbon absorbtion, with multiple models from simpler ones like constant growth and stochasic growth model , to more complicated models
that take into account the percentile carbon yeild from multiple runs and more.
This model is done from data from the module "ENVI70018 - Critical and Analytical Approaches to Environmental Resource Management 2024-2025" 
of M.Sc. programme "Environmental Technology" with specialization in "Envrironment Resource Management" from Imperial College London.
This model were adapted from an excel sheet model from the class by me as a self practice on MATLAB, as well as data analysis skills, to be used
as a project to be evaluated in my portfolio.
